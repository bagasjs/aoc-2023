# Day 5
This day's part 2 is really-really hard. I mean it's actually simple, the part 2 is just adding the amount of data.
But the reason this one is really hard is you need a fast algorithm. My first implementation was sucks and slow even
when I'm running it in release mode that my old laptop almost crash. This version is better in release mode It took 
arround 2-3 minutes. I think it's pretty reasonable since the amount of input is very big, considering the algorithm 
time complexity is actually O(N^3) theoretically there's no multithreading. Maybe there's a better solution, 
but I'm happy with this.
