# It's just me following advent of code in 2023
This is my first time following advent of code. I really want to try it for once to tests how good am I at
solving some algorithm related problems. I have learn programming for around 3 years right now by myself.
But never really took data structure, algorithm, and other CS related thing seriously, since a lot of my
programming journey is actually web-related and web-related things is full of frameworks or libraries, I've
never stuck with the problem related to DSA seriously when building those webs. The other reason why I do this year's AOC 
is to learn Rust. I know a bit of Rust, but I think I couldn't code with Rust comfortably. So I view AOC as a great chance 
to make myself could code in Rust comfortably. I don't have particular reason though to learn Rust. I know that investing
time to master one language is more beneficial but I love the challenge to learn new language. Especially Rust, I have tried
to learn this language since the beginning of this year but never really could focus to learn it, since It's very weird
at the first time.
