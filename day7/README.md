# Day 7
Day 7 is a bit harder than yesterday, by concept and algorithm I think this should be the hardest one, 
but the amount of input is pretty small so I don't think I have to change the algorithm that I use 
to make it performant. The program structure is a bit different today. I usually have the part 1
and part 2 to be answered in a single program. But this part I have to change "Jack" into "Joker"
so I think it would be troublesome to support both of them.
