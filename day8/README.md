# Day 8
A bit hard for today. Part 1 is easy. Part 2 is a bit tricky and is about finding the pattern around the problems.
I am not really good at finding pattern, that's why I search for some hints on internet (Not the answer). Someone is
talking about LCM about this problem and I immediately think that every starts has some steps until it backs to the
same step again. So I collect those steps and it's actually only two steps for each starts. The next thing is pretty
easy I tried my solution once for the example. I found that the second step is the answer for the example and assuming
that it will be also the answer for the real problem. I was right the answer is actually the least common multiple of 
the second step of each starts. I cheat again by using python to calculate LCM since I don't want to implement that in
Rust because I was doing the part 2 on day 9 since I have other things to do in Day 8.
